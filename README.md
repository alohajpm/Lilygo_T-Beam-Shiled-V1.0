# Lilygo_T-Beam-Shiled-V1.0
I removed the screen from my T-Beam (US Meshtastic V1.2) and installed the T-Beam-Shiled-V1.0; Only to find that there was no code to be found!? This isn't great, and I had the radio working and then messed it up so if someone wants to go from here please do! I would call this a solid starting point.
